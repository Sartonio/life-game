  'Long ago, the island was a living jewel — rolling green tiles, groves heavy with fruit, rivers of light. All of it was tended by a goddess who loved the world as a mother loves a newborn, walking the land each day to coax every seed into bloom.',
  'But the world was young, and the young grow. As the island learned to hold its own shape, the goddess came less often — a visit each season, then each year, trusting her creation to stand on its own.',
  'And in the quiet she left behind, a darkness began to seep in — a cold fog, a creeping sludge. It was temptation; it was the small surrenders and unkept promises that ask for nothing yet take everything.',
  "At first it was only a stain at the island's edge, and whenever it spread too far the goddess would return and cleanse the land with her light — and for a while the world remembered how to shine.",
  'But her visits grew rarer still, until one day they stopped altogether. With no one to push back the dark, the fog swallowed the groves, the rivers dimmed, and the island slowly withered into silence.',
  'So it remained through a long age of night… until you arrive. Where your feet touch the earth, one tree stands green and the tiles around it warm back to color — a single patch of living light in a drowned world. You are the seed of life. The rest is up to you.',
